# Development Log
> A successful final project is built slowly over many weeks not thrown together at the last minute. To incentivize good project pacing and to let your project mentor stay informed about the status of your work, each week you should add an entry to your log.md file in the development directory.

> Each entry should describe:

> - What goals you had set for the week and whether they were accomplished or not
> - What problems you encountered (if any) that prevented you from meeting your goals
> - What you plan to accomplish or attempt next week

> The development log will be graded for completion, detail, and honesty â€“ not progress. It is much better to truthfully evaluate the work you completed in a week then lie to make the project sound further along then it really is. It is totally acceptable to have an entry that says you tried nothing and accomplished nothing. However if every week starts to say that, both yourself and your project mentor will be able to identify the issue before it becomes impossible to fix.

## Week 5 (26 Jul - 1 Aug)

- I wanted to start by creating a deck of cardsd and a way of getting cards from it. This has not been randomised yet and will be by next week.
- I faced some problems in getting a card but I was just being foolish, it was easy.
- I will randomise the deck as right now it just gives the top card which is always the aceof something.

## Week 6 (2 Aug - 8 Aug)
- I wanted to randomise cards and be able to give 3 and so I did.
- I faced some problems with time due to OBS.
- I will create a bit of the user interface.

## Week 7 (9 Aug - 15 Aug)
- Made the player count and ability to deal the correct nuber of cards
- I faced some problems with the usage of user inputs in my code.
- I will create some more of the ui.
